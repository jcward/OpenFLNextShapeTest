# OpenFLNextShapeTest
A test case that visually shows four bugs when using OpenFL Next.

1. Linestyle with alpha = 0.5 is the wrong color in Next, both the red rectangle and the green circle
2. Gradient fill is missing in Next
3. ScrollRect doesn't work in Next
4. t.getBounds(this) returns top-left (instead of proper text .x and .y position) in Next
