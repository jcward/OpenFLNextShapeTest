# OpenFLNextShapeTest
A test case that shows 4 visual problems when using OpenFL Next.

// 1) Linestyle with alpha = 0.5 is the wrong color in Next,
//    both the red rectangle and the green circle
// 2) Gradient fill is missing in Next
// 3) ScrollRect doesn't work in Next
// 4) t.getBounds(this) returns top-left (instead of proper
//    text .x and .y position) in Next
